  * Most managerial accounting texts emphasize the mechanics of managerial accounting. While important, mechanics are not enough. To solve business problems, students need to understand how managerial accounting can improve decision-making, and when and where a particular tool or technique is appropriate.
 
  * Balakrishnan’s Managerial Accounting 1st edition presents accounting information in the context of business decision making. It combines the traditional topics of managerial accounting with a strategic framework that shows students how to construct decision models and measure information. By linking business decisions with accounting information students will be motivated to learn and make more informed decisions. Balakrishnan will appeal to courses where there is a true focus on decision making and accounting is placed within a business context.
